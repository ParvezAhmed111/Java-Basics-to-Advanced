IMMUTABLE CLASS:

- We can not change the value of an object once it is created.
- Declare class as 'final' so that it can not be extended.
- All class members should be private. So that direct access can be avoided.
- And class members are initialized only once using constructor.
- There should not be any setter methods, which is generally use to change the value.
- Just getter methods. And returns Copy of the member variable.

Example: String, Wrapper Classes etc.
