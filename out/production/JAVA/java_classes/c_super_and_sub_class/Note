Super and Sub Class:

A class that is derived from another class is called a Subclass.
And from class through which Subclass is derived its called Superclass.

Interview Question
In Java, in the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of Object class.
Object is the topmost class in Java.
It has some common methods like
    clone()
    toString()
    equals()
    notify()
    wait() etc...
