Abstract Class (0 to 100% Abstraction):

Show only important features to users and hide its internal implementation.
2 ways to achieve abstraction:
    1. Through interface
    2. Using abstract keyword

Class is declared as abstracted through keyword "abstract".
It can have both abstract(method without body) and non abstract methods.
We can not create an instance of this class.
We parent has some features which all child classes have in common, then this can be used.
Constructors can be created inside them. And with super keyword from child classes we can access them.

Example:

Car ---------------> LuxuryCar -------> Audi
(abstract class) (abstract class) (concrete class)
